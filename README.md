# ATHER

*Project Ather aims to reduce candidate's manual effort to generate cold emails, cover_letters, and referral emails.*

• Candidate's Resume is parsed and saved to MySQL DB in structures format.

• Personalized cold email and cover letter is generated based on the job description.

• Personalised Referral email is generated based on the job role.

The Codebase uses FastAPI Framework for backend, SQLAlchemy for Database and Langchain for prompting and generating structured outputs.
